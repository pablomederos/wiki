### Hi everyone!

Apparently, it's our Achilles' heel, but the time comes for every developer to have to document what they do. For themselves, as well as for those who come after. Therefore, I give you a warm welcome to this blog/wiki, where I intend to document things that I consider to be "advanced" or little-known, which I have learned and/or continue to learn. You won't find the absolute truth here, but you will find my constant research and a serious approach, in my own words, but with enough depth so as not to seem like a simple blog.

Of course, I use AI on occasion to make my words sound prettier (I think not doing so now, in the "Age of Ultron ;), would be shooting myself in the foot"), but I aim to offer content that is truly useful.
My focus is mainly on laguajes C#, C++, F# y C, exploring the vast world of .NET, video game development, or delving into software architecture and project management (Be patient if posts on everything I mentioned haven't appeared yet). The idea is to build this knowledge progressively, from the fundamentals to more advanced topics.

**La Cueva Dev** (The Dev Cave) is the space where I develop things, it's part of my personal project "La Cueva del Insecto" (The Insect's Cave), and this is an invitation to explore the articles I add and, if something resonates or questions arise, to join the conversation. I will enable comments soon, but right now you can contact me via [email](mailto:contacto@lacuevadelinsecto.dev?subject=Art%C3%ADculos%20de%20La%20Cueva%20del%20Insecto). This is a space to learn and enhance software development skills.
