# C and C++: Pillars of Systems and Application Programming
C and C++ are fundamental programming languages, renowned for their efficiency, low-level control, and versatility. C, the precursor to C++, is the language of choice for programming operating systems, device drivers, and embedded systems. C++ extends C's capabilities with object-oriented programming (OOP), making it a powerful option for developing high-performance applications, video games, enterprise software, and complex systems where performance and resource management are critical. Both languages remain indispensable tools in any developer's arsenal for building robust and optimized software.

In this Wiki, you'll find articles that reflect my experience, covering topics basic enough to be useful for newcomers to programming, as well as advanced enough to enhance any application implemented by experienced programmers in either of these two wonderful languages.
